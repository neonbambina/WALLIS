<p>                                                                                     has been dazzling audiences    
                                with her musical skills since she was a young child. Raised in 
                         Philadelphia, she got her first taste of performing arts at 
                  the tender age of two when her parents took her to a see 
     “Peter Pan” the musical. Mesmerized by the performance, WALLIS 
immediately declared that performing was what she wanted to do 
with her life. Delving into the local choir and theatre landscape 
eventually led to WALLIS being cast in a production of Annie on 
the very stage she saw her first show. Growing up with a musician 
for a father meant a steady stream of musical friends visiting their 
home and having impromptu performances, which she often joined. 
A songwriter by 9 years old, WALLIS became a paid performer 
singing cover songs in local theatres and cabarets by the time 
    she was 12. As she approached junior high school, WALLIS 
          decided to study her craft full time, pleading with her 
            parents for the opportunity to audition for a performing 
             arts charter school over an hour away from their home, 
                to which she was accepted and now attends 
                  as a sophomore.
